# Basic Onshape CAD
## Base
### This part was one of my first experiences with onshape. It is much snappier than Solidworks but I also have an ethernet connection so I suspect it will be worse on a Chromebook and spotty wifi. The workflow was different yet it was very manageable. It felt very much like a newer, cloud-based Solidworks. The shortcuts make it feel as if you could make simple parts very quickly if you could learn them. I didn't learn anything else of note, just got used to where buttons were for the most part. 
## Mount
### This part was really neat. I don't remember variables in Solidworks but it was much harder if I recall correctly. It was neat to see all the different methods as well. The workflow feels like it will be faster when my Onhape skills match my Soldiworks skills. Overall it's going very well. 
## Fork 
### This part was cool to make. The only learning that I can notice is familiarizing myself with how Onsphape works. It's so similar to Solidworks that it's very easy to transition. I feel like I can make parts much faster or at least I will be able to. All of the shortcuts are super cool and helpful. 
## Tire
### I got even more comfertable with Onshape while making this part. It all felt easy and intuative. One of my favorite parts of the process was changing the color and material of the part. Over the summer I tried to do that in Solidworks and it went very badly, this looks a good deal easier. 
## Wheel
### The wheel was a cool part. It was basic but really showed some of it's strengths. One thing I loved was not having to make one solid closed geometry like with Solidworks. That was really cool and really helped. The face-wide fillets were also cool but that is a feature in Solidworks (I think). I also prefer the constrain system, my only concern is that if somone who was doing very advanced things and the computer making so many assumptions hurts their porductivity, I doubt it though. 
## Axle, Collar, Bearings
### This assignment was neat because it showed how fast Onshape is. The speed that these cars can be made is super impressive compared to Solidworks. Speed is not always the best metric though so I'm not sure which program I prefer. It is also of not how much faster I can get into onshape that Solidworks. I decided to put this to the test. I made a part in Onshape and Solidworks, a 20mm cube with a 10mm hole and 2mm fillets on all faces. Solidworks clocked in at exactly 2 minutes but an entire minute of that was loading. Onshape clocked in at 2 minutes and 20 seconds. A good deal slower but I also made lots of mistakes. I consistently forgot how different the workflow was, failed to utilize shortcuts, and accidentally drew a construction circle instead of the non-construction circle I needed. Overall, Onshape has the skills to beat Solidworks but I'm not there with my skillset.
