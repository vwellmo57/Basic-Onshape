# Basic Onshape CAD
## Base
### This part was one of my first experiences with onshape. It is much snappier than Solidworks but I also have an ethernet connection so I suspect it will be worse on a Chromebook and spotty wifi. The workflow was different yet it was very manageable. It felt very much like a newer, cloud-based Solidworks. The shortcuts make it feel as if you could make simple parts very quickly if you could learn them. I didn't learn anything else of note, just got used to where buttons were for the most part.
