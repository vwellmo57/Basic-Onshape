# Basic Onshape CAD
## Base
### This part was one of my first experiences with onshape. It is much snappier than Solidworks but I also have an ethernet connection so I suspect it will be worse on a Chromebook and spotty wifi. The workflow was different yet it was very manageable. It felt very much like a newer, cloud-based Solidworks. The shortcuts make it feel as if you could make simple parts very quickly if you could learn them. I didn't learn anything else of note, just got used to where buttons were for the most part. 
##Mount
###This part was really neat. I don't remember variables in Solidworks but it was much harder if I recall correctly. It was neat to see all the different methods as well. The workflow feels like it will be faster when my Onhape skills match my Soldiworks skills. Overall it's going very well.
