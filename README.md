# Basic Onshape 
## Base
### This part was one of my first experiences with onshape. It is much snappier than Solidworks but I also have an ethernet connection so I suspect it will be worse on a Chromebook and spotty wifi. The workflow was different yet it was very manageable. It felt very much like a newer, cloud-based Solidworks. The shortcuts make it feel as if you could make simple parts very quickly if you could learn them. I didn't learn anything else of note, just got used to where buttons were for the most part. 
## Mount
### This part was really neat. I don't remember variables in Solidworks but it was much harder if I recall correctly. It was neat to see all the different methods as well. The workflow feels like it will be faster when my Onhape skills match my Soldiworks skills. Overall it's going very well. 
## Fork 
### This part was cool to make. The only learning that I can notice is familiarizing myself with how Onsphape works. It's so similar to Solidworks that it's very easy to transition. I feel like I can make parts much faster or at least I will be able to. All of the shortcuts are super cool and helpful. 
## Tire
### I got even more comfertable with Onshape while making this part. It all felt easy and intuative. One of my favorite parts of the process was changing the color and material of the part. Over the summer I tried to do that in Solidworks and it went very badly, this looks a good deal easier. 
## Wheel
### The wheel was a cool part. It was basic but really showed some of it's strengths. One thing I loved was not having to make one solid closed geometry like with Solidworks. That was really cool and really helped. The face-wide fillets were also cool but that is a feature in Solidworks (I think). I also prefer the constrain system, my only concern is that if somone who was doing very advanced things and the computer making so many assumptions hurts their porductivity, I doubt it though. 
## Axle, Collar, Bearings
### This assignment was neat because it showed how fast Onshape is. The speed that these cars can be made is super impressive compared to Solidworks. Speed is not always the best metric though so I'm not sure which program I prefer. It is also of not how much faster I can get into onshape that Solidworks. I decided to put this to the test. I made a part in Onshape and Solidworks, a 20mm cube with a 10mm hole and 2mm fillets on all faces. Solidworks clocked in at exactly 2 minutes but an entire minute of that was loading. Onshape clocked in at 2 minutes and 20 seconds. A good deal slower but I also made lots of mistakes. I consistently forgot how different the workflow was, failed to utilize shortcuts, and accidentally drew a construction circle instead of the non-construction circle I needed. Overall, Onshape has the skills to beat Solidworks but I'm not there with my skillset. 
## Wheel and Axel
### This was my first experience with Onsphapes mates and it was not great. It felt very odd and was sort of fiddly. I believe that it will get easier but this was not very easy. 
## Caster Assembly
### Onshape is amazing. The mates finally started to click and it is so easy. What I also found amazing was how few mates are needed. In Solidworks it takes 2-3 mates to define a part, Onshape can do it in one. One final note, adding hardware felt much easier and more intuitive than Solidworks, I liked not having to go through one tree but instead a series of dropdowns. One thing I had difficulty with was getting the setscrew to work. I'm sure it's due to me being a total novice but it was the only part that really slowed me down. 
## Dowel Pins
### This was very cool. The configurations were so easy to implament and use. It makes you actually want to use them. For the frame I had the configuration control 2 dimensions and it worked perfectly. I had some minor hiccups mating everything but that's just me being new. All-in-all it was very easy and smooth.
